AnS [Auction Sniper] CHANGES 1.0.5
-------------------

* Added key bindings for buying selected auction, or buying the first auction listed (Available under ESC -> Bindings - > AnS)
* Adjusted the display of how groups are shown. It now says: x stack of x item name. For example: 10 stack of 200 Tidespray Linen. Which means there are 10 stacks in the group and each stack consists of 200 Tidespray Linen.
* Armor, weapons, pets, and other equippable items now will show the dress up window with that item or pet, when selected.
* Now prevents buying if a new AH query has been sent. This helps prevent from buying the wrong item during the transition.
* If you are spam buying, then a 0.5 second delay is added before sending a new AH query. Maximum up to 4 second delay on sending the new query. (Do not confuse this with purchasing, you can still spam purchase!). This is to keep the listing from changing until you are done buying for a period of time.
* Added where SHIFT-Left Clicking an auction listing will blacklist it temporarily until the AH is closed.
